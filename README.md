# StreamX

Make Flink|Spark easier

> A magical framework that makes Flink development easier

## 🚀 Introduction

The original intention of `StreamX` is to make the development of `Flink` easier. `StreamX` focuses on the management of development phases
and tasks. Our ultimate goal is to build a one-stop big data solution integrating stream processing, batch processing, data warehouse and
data laker.

## 🏳‍🌈 Components

`Streamx` consists of three parts,`streamx-core`,`streamx-pump` and `streamx-console`

![](http://assets.streamxhub.com/streamx1.png)

### 1️⃣ streamx-core

`streamx-core` is a framework that focuses on coding, standardizes configuration, and develops in a way that is better than configuration by
convention. Also it provides a development-time `RunTime Content` and a series of `Connector` out of the box. At the same time, it
extends `DataStream` some methods, and integrates `DataStream` and `Flink sql` api to simplify tedious operations, focus on the business
itself, and improve development efficiency and development experience.

### 2️⃣ streamx-pump

`streamx-pump` is a planned data extraction component, similar to `flinkx`. Based on the various `connector` provided in `streamx-core`, the
purpose is to create a convenient, fast, out-of-the-box real-time data extraction and migration component for big data, and it will be
integrated into the `streamx-console`.

### 3️⃣ streamx-console

`streamx-console` is a stream processing and `Low Code` platform, capable of managing `Flink` tasks, integrating project compilation,
deploy, configuration, startup, `savepoint`, `flame graph`, `Flink SQL`, monitoring and many other features. Simplify the daily operation
and maintenance of the `Flink` task.

Our ultimate goal is to build a one-stop big data solution integrating stream processing, batch processing, data warehouse and data laker.

Thanks to the above excellent open source projects and many outstanding open source projects that are not mentioned, for giving the greatest
respect, special thanks to [Apache Zeppelin](http://zeppelin.apache.org)
, [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), Thanks to the [fire-spark](https://github.com/GuoNingNing/fire-spark) project for the
early inspiration and help.

### 🚀 Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/streamxhub/streamx.git
cd streamx
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Denv=prod
```

## 👻 Why not...❓

### Apache Zeppelin

[Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org) is a Web-based notebook that enables data-driven, interactive data analytics and
collaborative documents with SQL, Java, Scala and more.

At the same time we also need a one-stop tool that can cover `development`, `test`, `package`, `deploy`, and `start`.
`streamx-console` solves these pain points very well, positioning is a one-stop stream processing platform, and has developed more exciting
features (such as `Flink SQL WebIDE`, `dependency isolation`, `task rollback `, `flame diagram`
etc.)

### FlinkX

[FlinkX](http://github.com/DTStack/flinkx) is a distributed offline and real-time data synchronization framework based on flink widely used
in DTStack, which realizes efficient data migration between multiple heterogeneous data sources.

`StreamX` focuses on the management of development phases and tasks. The `streamx-pump` module is also under planning, dedicated to solving
data source migration, and will eventually be integrated into the `streamx-console`.
