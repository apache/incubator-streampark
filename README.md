# StreamX

Make stream processing easier

> A magical framework that make stream processing easier!

## üöÄ Introduction

Apache Flink and Apache Spark are widely used as the next generation of big data streaming computing engines.  Based on a bench of excellent experiences combined with best practices, we extracted the task deployment and runtime parameters into the configuration files. In this way,  an easy-to-use RuntimeContext with out-of-the-box connectors would bring easier and more efficient task development experience. It reduces the learning cost and development barriers, hence developers can focus on the business logic.
On the other hand, It can be challenge for enterprises to use Flink & Spark if there is no professional management platform for Flink & Spark tasks during the deployment phase. StreamX provides such a professional task management platform, including task development, scheduling, interactive query, deployment, operation, maintenance, etc.

## üè≥‚Äçüåà Components

`Streamx` consists of three parts,`streamx-core`,`streamx-pump` and `streamx-console`

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ streamx-core

`streamx-core` is a framework that focuses on coding, standardizes configuration, and develops in a way that is better than configuration by
convention. Also it provides a development-time `RunTime Content` and a series of `Connector` out of the box. make application development easier
developer focus on the business itself, and improve development efficiency and development experience.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ streamx-pump

`streamx-pump` is a planned data extraction component. Based on the various `connector` provided in `streamx-core`, the
purpose is to create a convenient, fast, out-of-the-box real-time data extraction and migration component for big data, and it will be
integrated into the `streamx-console`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ streamx-console

`streamx-console` is a stream processing and `Low Code` platform, capable of managing `Flink` & `Spark` tasks, integrating project compilation,
deploy, configuration, startup, `savepoint`, `flame graph`, monitoring and many other features. Simplify the daily operation
and maintenance of the `Flink` & `Spark` task.

Our ultimate goal is to build a one-stop big data solution integrating stream processing, batch processing, data warehouse.
